# Pathways Minimal App

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold to use as a fresh starting point. Drop in your components or replace files in `src/`.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend/minimal-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Dev server will run on `http://localhost:5174` by default.

Notes:
- This is intentionally small — feel free to replace `src/` with your own files.
- If you want me to copy specific files from the existing app into this folder, tell me which files and where to place them.
